<li>Demonstration of autonomous aerial water sampling system at <a href="http://blueoakranch.ucnrs.org/">Blue Oak Ranch Reserve</a>, near San Jose, CA, USA.    UAV uses GPS to navigate over the water body, then uses ultrasonic sensors and conductivity sensors to detect the water's surface.  The pump has to be submerged to prime before turning it on.  Can collect 3 separate water samples and purge the system between sampling locations by shooting water overboard.

<li>Pumping water through a 67-micron screen to filter for Zebra Mussel 'Velligers' (baby Zebra Mussels).  Initial results indicate this method is effective.

<li>Water sampling UAV crashes into water on a cold morning.  A single motor reported it was on and spinning even though it stuttered and momentarily provided no thrust.  Lessons learned:  1) Launch away from shore; 2) freshwater crashes don't destroy electronics (because freshwater is not a good conductor, unlike saltwater).

<li>3-D Water thermal structure interpolated from temperature readings taken from a thermometer suspended from a UAV.  Video reveals internal thermal structure of approximately 6x6 meters of a lake at UC Berkeley's <a href="http://blueoakranch.ucnrs.org/">Blue Oak Ranch Reserve</a>.

<li>Laser scans from a SICK-TIM571 with Vicon markers to localize readings.  Scans show the perimeter of the VICON cage at the NIMBUS Lab.

<li>Simulink model of UAV with cable-suspended payload demonstrating pathological behavior when cable imparts a small spring force.  Cable is modeled as a series of links.

<li>Simulink model of UAV translating between two waypoints including a change in attitude (rotation).  Used to validate model with behavior of real quadcoptors.
